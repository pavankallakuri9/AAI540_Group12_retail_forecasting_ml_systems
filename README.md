# 📦 Retail Demand Forecasting for Inventory Optimization

### ML Systems Project – Team Assignment 2.1

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Retail businesses constantly struggle with **stockouts** (lost sales) and **overstocking** (high inventory holding costs).
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning–based demand forecasting system** that predicts short-term product demand at a granular level (Store × Product × Day).

The forecasts generated by this system will help support:

* 📉 Reduced stockouts
* 📦 Optimized inventory levels
* 💰 Lower carrying costs
* 📊 Data-driven replenishment decisions

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a **time-series forecasting ML system** that predicts **daily unit sales** for each store-product combination over a **14–28 day horizon**, along with **uncertainty bounds** for safety stock planning.

---

## 🔍 Problem Type

This is a **supervised machine learning regression problem** with a **time-series forecasting** structure.

We will use **historical sales data + external features** (holidays, store metadata, etc.) to predict future demand.

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate model performance using both **technical** and **business-relevant** metrics:

### Technical Metrics

* **WAPE** (Weighted Absolute Percentage Error) – primary metric
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* MASE (Mean Absolute Scaled Error)
* Forecast Bias

### Business Metrics (Impact-Oriented)

* Stockout rate
* Fill rate
* Inventory turnover

---

## 🧰 Modeling Approach

We will compare multiple models, starting from simple baselines to more advanced ML models:

### Baseline Models

* Seasonal Naïve Forecast
* Moving Average

### Candidate ML Models

* Gradient Boosting (LightGBM / XGBoost)
* Feature-based regression using lag & rolling window features

### Optional Advanced Models

* Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
* DeepAR

## 📊 Data Sources

**Primary Dataset:**
**Kaggle – Store Sales Time Series Forecasting (Corporación Favorita)**

This dataset contains:

* Daily sales by store and product family
* Store metadata
* Holiday and event data
* Oil prices
* Transactions data

This allows us to model:

* Seasonality
* Store-level differences
* Event-driven demand shifts

## 🚫 Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

To keep the project focused and feasible within the timeline, we are **not** covering:

* Direct ERP or purchase order automation
* Promotion optimization or price elasticity modeling
* Real-time intraday forecasting
* Cold-start forecasting for brand-new products with zero history
